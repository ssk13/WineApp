<img class="wine-img" src="../../img/redwine.PNG">

<p>A Pinot Noir's color can be any of a range of colors - from cherry red to puple-red and even brown as the wine ages. Typical flavors include earth, leather, vanilla (from the oak), and jam ... the fruity flavors of the jam often taste like raspberry, strawberry, and plum. </p>

<p>Pinot Noirs go well with pasta with red sauce, or lighter beef dishes. Also, any local game you might have, or even goose would do well. It should be served at around 61F. While some pinot noirs are meant to be drunk immediately, a fine pinot noir can easily age for 10 years or more.</p>
