<h2>Zinfandel</h2>
<img class="wine-img" src="../../img/zinfandel.png">

<p>The color of a zinfandel wine is deep red, bordering on black. Zinfandel is a spicy, peppery wine, with a hint of fruity flavor - berries or dark cherries are often the taste range. Zinfandel goes well with "typical American" food - pizza, burgers, and steaks. It's hearty enough to match up with thick red sauces. </p>

<p>Red zinfandel, depending on how heavy the particular one you're drinking is, is best anywhere between about 57F and 67F. This temperature range is not as warm as room temperature nor is it as cold as fridge temperature. It's somewhere in the middle. </p>
