<img class="wine-img" src="../../img/whitewine.PNG">

<p>Depending on where it's grown and how it's fermented, Chardonnay can taste semi-sweet or sour, heady or light. Typical flavors are apple, tangerine, lemon, lime, melon, and oak. Also, Chardonnay is not a "rich man's drink". A surprisingly good chardonnay can cost under $10. </p>

<p>Chardonnay is usually dry, and goes best with poultry or seafood, like lobster or scallops. It can even go well with a light red meat dish. Good cheeses for Chardonnay include Gruyere, Provolone, and Brie.</p>
