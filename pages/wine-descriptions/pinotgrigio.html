<h2>Pinot Grigio</h2>
<img class="wine-img" src="../../img/whitewine.png">

<p>Most pinot grigio wines are created in Italy. The Italian version of pinot grigio is typically dry (not sweet) and light, with a mineral taste to it. Californian variants of pinot grigio tend to be richer in flavor, but still have the mineral taste. Often, they finish with a lemony or citrusy flavor. </p>

<p>French pinot gris wines tend to come from the Alsace region. These are more fruity and flowery than their Italian counterparts, though they still have that mineral aroma. Flavors can range from peach to grapefruit to melon. </p>

<p>Pinot grigio pairs well with light dishes that are still on the "thick" side, like chicken in a rich white sauce, or eggplant with heavy spices. Pinot grigio is a white wine, but it is able to hold its own against richer flavors. It should be served at 48F. </p>
