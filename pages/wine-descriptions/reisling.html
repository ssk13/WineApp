<h2>Reisling</h2>
<img class="wine-img" src="../../img/whitewine.PNG">

<p>Riesling is a late-ripening grape, and only has a moderate yield. This makes it difficult to grow, and often the price reflects this. A cheap Riesling might be sharp, but a well grown riesling will be a sweet but complex white wine that ages very well. Riesling is affected by where it is grown - Californian Rieslings tend to be dry and have a melony taste, while Germanic Rieslings are more tart and 'grapefruity'. Other typical Riesling flavors include fruity and floral, as well as honey and musky. Rieslings should be served cool at 47F (but not as cold as fridge temperature). </p>

<p>Riesling goes very well with oriental dishes. It also goes well with seafood of all types, and is one of the few wines that goes well with chocolate. It is also great on its own, as a dessert wine. In Ontario, Canada, Riesling is used in the creation of Ice Wines. </p>
