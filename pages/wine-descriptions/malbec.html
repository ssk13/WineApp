<p>This black grape creates a rustic, mid-bodied wine, but is most often used in blending with other wines. In Argentina it is almost the most-planted red grape, and is the third most planted in Chile. </p>

<p>Malbec goes well with roast meats such as chicken or turkey. It should be served at 58F and can be aged for up to 5 years typically. </p>
